Boneless is meant as a tool to display websites without the overhead of tabs, decorations, and other interface elements that can make it bloaty.

This is NOT meant as a browser. It's meant for displaying websites that don't change often in spare monitors/desktops.

It supports up to 4 different websites displayed at the same time.

It provides 16 different tiling layouts to choose from.

It supports saving configurations as presets, to easily jump between different experiences.

It supports changing the theme color, which affects the top panel and application windows.

Buttons to refresh and swap urls.

Proportions for each tiled webview can be configured.

Supports multiple workspaces. Presets can be autostarted to start each on a space.

### Installation

Creating a build is recommended so the application's config files don't reside in the generic Electron directory.
There is a script to create a build (create_builds.sh)
You can modify this to target your platform or architecture:
>npm install

>Check/Edit create_builds.sh

>chmod +x create_builds.sh

>./create_builds.sh

To run it without building it
>npm install

>npm start
